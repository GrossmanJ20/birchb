<body><h1> In week 1 of Digital Fabrication and Engineering, we worked through several design challenges. The challenge
  in this one was to build a structure out of straws, tape, and string that could hold a cup full of pennies without
  collapsing. Whichever group's build held the most pennies won. My group won, of course. </h1></body>
