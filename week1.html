<body><h2> In week 1 of Digital Fabrication and Engineering, we worked through several
design challenges. This challenge in particular was to build a structure out of straws,
tape, and string that could hold a cup full of pennies without collapsing. Whichever
group's build held the most pennies won. My group won, of course. </h2>
